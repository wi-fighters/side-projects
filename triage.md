# Ideation: Triage (sorting)

## Probably (if you put in the time, I reckon you got this)

### CSS art

- Christmas tree
- Snow globe
- draw a phone in HTML + CSS. If there's time, add JS interactivity
- animal walking around with hover effects
- Animation using keyframes

### Information website

- Redesign a website: 2 pages of new CSS for an existing HTML structure (inspiration: https://www.art.yale.edu/about/contact)... JS only if there's extra time

- Homepage / landing page for a real-world website

- Numerology site: Enter a date, get an image + description back (can't tell you lotto numbers)

### JS app (mostly back end)

- Kitchen duty generator (focus on either the front end or back end... both in a week would be a _Maybe_)

- Decision tree (focus on either the front or the back) e.g. Identify why the tree is sick

- Konfigurate your own pizza (toppings, maybe prices...)

### Front-end prototypes for a larger app

- Prototype of a UGC (user-generated content) web app for posting anonymous letters

- Prototype for a flashcard app (e.g. for learning language vocabulary)

- Prototype for 2 views of a mobile app (as a mobile-only website). Layout first, then if there's time, add complexity (fancy graphics / polish / more views)


## Maybe later (cool idea, but not this week)

Drag and drop interface (e.g. for a kanban board)

hmmm APIs....
