# Ideation: Triage (sorting)

## Probably (if you put in the time, I reckon you got this)

CSS art: Christmas tree
CSS art: Snow globe
CSS art: draw a phone in HTML + CSS. If there's time, add JS interactivity
CSS art: animal walking around with hover effects

Website: HTML + CSS (inspiration: https://www.art.yale.edu/about/contact)... JS only if there's extra time

CSS art: Animation using keyframes

Kitchen duty generator (focus on either the front end or back end... both in a week would be a _Maybe_)

Decision tree (focus on either the front or the back) e.g. Identify why the tree is sick

Konfigurate your own pizza (toppings, maybe prices...)

Prototype of a UGC (user-generated content) web app for posting anonymous letters

Prototype for a flashcard app (e.g. for learning language vocabulary)

Prototype for 2 views of a mobile app (as a mobile-only website). Layout first, then if there's time, add complexity (fancy graphics / polish / more views).

Numerology site: Enter a date, get an image + desscription back (can't tell you lotto numbers)

Homepage / landing page for a real-world website

## Maybe (sounds ambitious, but you might surprise me)

## Maybe later (cool idea, but not this week)

Drag and drop interface (e.g. for a kanban board)

hmmm APIs....
