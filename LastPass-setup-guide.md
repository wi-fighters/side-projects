# Set up your password manager

With the power of being creative on the Internet comes the responsibility to pay attention to security: your own, and that of anyone who uses what you build.

If you're not yet using a password manager, please [set up LastPass for free](https://www.lastpass.com/).

When working with websites you will need to keep track of many passwords and share some of them with colleagues and/or clients.

A password manager can also improve the security of your personal accounts if you follow recommendations and make the most of it.

## The only passwords you should need to memorise

**Make all these [both strong and memorable](https://www.malwarefox.com/set-strong-memorable-passwords/)**.

1. Master password to your password manager
2. Passwords to unlock devices (Computer, Apple ID)
3. Email password (recovery email will go here if you sign in from new devices)
4. Anything you'll need to type in when you don't have easy access to LastPass. Since LastPass has great phone apps too, this should be very few situations if any.

From now on, you can [generate all other passwords securely](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator) and save them to LastPass instead of bothering with trying to remember them. Generally, the longer the better, but some apps / websites will require you to stay under a certain length.

As you get used to using LastPass, you can replace your old insecure passwords this way as well.
