# Project Planning

- WBS work breakdown structure (to do list) and the time estimates.
- This is a **rough example of guesses**. I encourage you to make similar estimates, but they will be different for everybody.

## front-end layout

### set up

- Set up time tracking - 20 mins
- Set up my filesystem - 5 mins
- Create a GitHub repo + set up permissions (collaborator/s) - 10 mins

Create the README (based project-log-template.md) 30 mins

### plan

- Decide which devices to support - 2 mins
- Scribble (create wireframes) - 40 mins
- Get feedback on wireframes - 20 mins

* Source or create assets + content + branding (text, fonts, images, colors)
    - text
    - fonts
    - images
    - colors

* Technical research (flexbox, animations, how to...) - 5 hours

### build

- Make an **outline first** (HTML, CSS, write what you know)
    - HTML with <!-- TODO: research keyframes --> - 1 hour
    - first styles - 3 hours

    <!--
        TODO: break this task down into smaller tasks, e.g.:
        - add header
        - align header items
        - etc etc (you will discover more tasks as you continue. listing them as you go can help keep you on track)
    -->

- **Research with specific goals** only once your outline is done

### Always be testing

- Try it on different devices - 1 hour
- Show it to people (acceptance testing) - 1 hour
