# Mini Solo Project

Workshop: Tues 17 Dec 2019

Project duration: 1 week

## Intro


## Ideation phase

### Goal

Come up with lots and lots of ideas. Quantity over quality. Fill a page on both sides. Trust the process.

### How

Start alone, then get into groups and discuss.


## Triage phase

### Goal

Narrow down ideas to the most feasible.

### How

Call out your ideas and your teacher will triage them according to feasibility:
Probably / Maybe / Maybe later

Together we'll discuss some possible hidden complexities of the ideas contributed.


## Shortlist

### Goal

Flesh out the ideas that people are most interested in.

### How

For each idea, discuss:

- Is this a real project (does someone really want this built?) or is it just an exercise?
- Who is the intended user? (Only you, for practice? Recruiters/interviewers? A real client's real users?)
- Who is the sponsor (client), if there is one?
- What content is required? How will you obtain / create it? How will that impact your timeline?
- What work needs to be done? In what order (priorities/dependencies)?

## Project selection and kickoff

### Goal

Decide on a project, make a plan, find a buddy and get started.

### How

- If you're interested in the same project as other people, take a moment to discuss all your different ideas as a group, before getting started on your solo projects. Your perspectives may inspire each other :)

- Make a plan for when you will set aside time to work on this
- Find a buddy to keep you accountable (you will nag each other to stick to good `git` habits)
- Talk your project through with your teacher and get started


## Set up checklist

- Create a free LastPass account. Keep all your project-related passwords here.
- Create a free Toggl account. Record the time you spend on your project.

- Repo setup with your buddy (pair program this part, keep each other on track):

    - Clone this repo.
    - Create your own branch (use your name, e.g. `eva`).
    - Create your own directory (e.g. `2019-12-17 <project-name>`). Keep your project files in this directory to avoid conflicts.
